# Lab-3
In this lab I chose to represent a common sorting algorithim in two imperative style programming languages. The languages chosen were C++ and Python and the sorting algorithim chosen was bubble sort, where an array get iterated through and, assuming we are ordeing lowest to highest, if an item in a position is greater than the item next to it, it will be swapped.
